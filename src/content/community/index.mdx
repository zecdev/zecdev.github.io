## The Zcasher's Wishlist

If you are feeling like meaninfully contributing to Zcash adoption here are a few ideas!

Some time ago we [asked Zcashers](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/lets-create-the-zcasher-wish-list/51143) to post ideas, products or applications that Zcash did 
not have and they would love to see them become a reality. positive and negative emojis were used to keep a score of 
the most popular ideas.

The objective of this wishlist is that it helps attract developers interested in developing these ideas and turn them 
into products of a vibrant and growing *Zeconomy*.

## Block Explorer Directory

Aaal from Zingo Labs made a survey of [Block Explorers for Zcash](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/block-explorer-directory/52158) available on the
web right now.* I hope it is valuable to the community as-is, and also can be 
extended if other community members want to offer links or updates.
