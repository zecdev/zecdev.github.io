# Contributing to Zcash Z3 Stack

## Zallet

GitHub: https://github.com/zcash/wallet

Currently the Zallet team is developing the RPC API of the wallet. There are a 
lot of issues to grab and contribute!


## Zaino 

GitHub: https://github.com/zingolabs/zaino

Zaino is an indexer for the Zcash blockchain implemented in Rust.

Zaino provides all necessary functionality for "light" clients (wallets and other 
applications that don't rely on the complete history of blockchain) and "full" 
clients / wallets and block explorers providing access to both the finalized chain
and the non-finalized best chain and mempool held by either a Zebra or Zcashd 
full validator.

## Zebra

GitHub: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra

[Zebra](https://zebra.zfnd.org/) is a Zcash full-node written in Rust.  
Zebra implements all the features required to reach Zcash network consensus, 
and the network stack is interoperable with zcashd. [Here](https://docs.rs/zebrad/latest/zebrad/index.html#zebra-advantages) 
are some benefits of Zebra.  
Zebra validates blocks and transactions, but needs extra software to generate them:

* To generate transactions, [run Zebra with lightwalletd](https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/lightwalletd.html).  
* To generate blocks, use a mining pool or miner with Zebra's mining JSON-RPCs. Currently Zebra can only send mining rewards to a single fixed address. To distribute rewards, use mining software that creates its own distribution transactions, a light wallet or the zcashd wallet.

## ZeWIF

ZeWIF is a joint project between Blockchain Commons and [Zingo Labs](https://zingolabs.org/), 
sponsored by a [Zcash Community Grant](https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/). 
It was created in part to support the deprecation of the 
[zcashd reference wallet](https://z.cash/ecosystem/zcashd/)but moreso to create 
a format that supports [Openness and Indepence](https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/) 
by allowing users to easily migrate among Zcash wallets without concern of loss 
of funds.
