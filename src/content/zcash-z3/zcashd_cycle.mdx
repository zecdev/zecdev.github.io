# Zcashd version lifecycle: the Zcash ecosystem metronome. 

Every 16 weeks a Zcashd version *dies* and a new one *is born*. This happens 
whether Zcashd code is being substantially changed or not. Once a version is 
released, *it can’t be stopped*. Nobody can tell you which version of Zcashd to 
run. Zcashd is designed to stop running at a given blockheight and operators have
to update their version to keep validating (or mining) blocks. This means that 
if you need to release a new version of Zcashd, for the case it requires the 
current supported version to stop working, you need to wait until the 
End-of-Support (EOS) of the current version. 

This means that the feature that you finish developing today in Zcashd, will 
only see the light of day on mainnet after the EOS date of the current version, 
when the version that includes that feature becomes the current version (provided 
that it doesn’t need a transition cycle). Sometimes that could mean a day, others 
it can mean 16 weeks. That’s how this metronome keeps a decentralized, 
permissionless and censorship-resistant protocol keeps everyone coordinated in 
terms of software releases. 

The timeline below shows the current Zcash version and the milestones where the 
support of the next three versions end.

The next Zcashd EOS is January 21st 2026\. This entails that whenever the Zcash 
development teams have consensus that Zcashd deprecation development is complete, 
then the ecosystem will need a whole EOS cycle to occur in order to deploy the 
proper versions that will stop the current supported Zcashd version and allow 
the Zcash maintainers to create and deploy the **End-of-Life** version of Zcashd. 

The Z3 development cross-team group gathered and estimated that it is acceptable 
to assess that Zcashd deprecation development completion window could span between 
now and May 2026 (Zcashd 6.10.1 EOS). This leaves the 16 weeks between 6.10.1 and 
6.10.2 to be the cycle buffer where the Z3 infrastructure could co-exist in 
production with Zcashd for the case NU7 is set to activate in September 2026

This means that NU7 could be targeted for activation after September 2026 indicated 
by Zcashd 6.10.2 EOS Milestone provided that it is feature complete and the NU 
process can be carried out by then, with the good practices that the Zcash core 
developers have been doing all of these years.

## Towards a friction-less Network Upgrade process

Zcash core developers are researching ways to reduce the impact of Network 
Upgrades that include transaction changes. This means less hassle for wallet and 
infrastructure providers and a higher pace for smaller updates even if they do 
include transaction format changes. Core developers are committed to improve UX 
for all ecosystem actors including the most tech savvy ones.
