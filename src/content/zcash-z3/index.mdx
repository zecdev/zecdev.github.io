# A new Zcash technology Stack 
Zcash was created from a bitcoin-core fork from 2015. Zcashd has been the 
main consensus node over 9 years. A complex machinery that combines legacy 
C++ code from Satoshi's Era, cutting edge Zero Knowledge Proofs, RustLang
code, a full-node wallet, mining and blockchain indexing RPCs. 

That's a lot! It all came to the point where the community voted that developers
focus on making Zcash Shielded Assets a reality. But after an in-depth analysis,
it was determined that in order to be able to keep advancing the protocol, Zcashd
would have to be replaced because the effort of adding new features was huge and 
deemed an inefficient allocation of the development resources of the Zcash 
development budget.  ECC core developers made the decision of starting to 
deprecate Zcashd in favor of a new technology stack composed of Zebra, a RustLang
modern consensus node  developed by the Zcash Foundation engineering team and, 
Zaino an indexer called developed by ZingoLabs. ECC would be in charge of 
developing the full-node wallet that would connect to Zaino and Zebra called 
Zallet.

Zcashd deprecation is a cross-team ecosystem-wide effort which is targeted for
end of 2025. 

## Zcashd Deprecation is now Z^3

Zcashd Deprecation was deemed a negative narrative. In order to focus in the 
positive aspects of the outcomes of this proces, it was then renamed to 
Z^3 (Zebra x Zaino x Zallet). If you'd like to contribute to Z3, check out the

"Zee Three" or "Zee to the Three" is an original idea from Zancas (ZingoLabs).
