## Zaino
Zaino is an indexer for the Zcash blockchain implemented in Rust by [ZingoLabs](https://github.com/zingolabs)

Zaino provides all necessary functionality for "light" clients (wallets and other
applications that don't rely on the complete history of blockchain) and "full" 
clients / wallets and block explorers providing access to both the finalized chain 
and the non-finalized best chain and mempool held by either a Zebra or Zcashd full 
validator.

## Zallet

Prononced Zall√®t (like Ballet), it's the replacement for the Zcashd full-node

## Legacy (Zcashd)

Zcashd is the originary consensus node for Zcash. Forked from Bitcoin-core in 2015,
Zcashd has gone through six Network Upgrades and has been the main consensus node
since the Zcash network was deployed in October 28th 2016. It's currently being 
deprecated and will soon be replaced by Zebra when the Network Upgrade 7 (NU7) is
deployed.

ECC Engineers will be posting updates on this website:

## Zcash Block Explorer

ZBE is a (originally) ZCG funded project which is currently maintained by all
Zcash teams. The ZBE is a good way to get to know how transaction look like in 
Zcash

## Zcash Dev Tool

Meet the Dev Tool! It's the best way to fiddle around or build a new feature for
Zcash! See great examples of how to parse addreses, transactions, sync a wallet
or finding out what's what in a transaction.
